# vending-machine
Digital Logic project using Logic Work5

# quick start
Open "vending-machine.cct" via "Logic Work 5"
All done!

# How to use
"vending-machine.cct" consists of 3 Part 
  1. input/output part
  2. state logic part
  3. coputational part
 just play with the 1st part and the machine will not crash:)

# state logic
I wrote all states and the next states table in the in.txt (stageLogic.txt is a scrap paper with incorrect spelling "stage" in the name)
BTW, this yields the logical term via espresso
to do that
  1. open cmd
  2. cd path/to/project
  3. espresso -o eqntott in.txt
  boom! magic happens! now that is the logic of the states and next states
